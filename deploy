          [:p "An idea formed as I thought about my love of hearts, writing, and Psalm 119:130, \"The unfolding of Your Words gives light\". My idea grew into a tri-fold heart-shaped design that expressed what was in my heart. The cardinal to the left is an example of the cover on one of the cards that will become available when that dream becomes reality."]
          [:p "The artwork for each card shows growth and transformation, because that is what I experienced when I chose to enter into the process of changing my old patterns of thinking that had kept me in hurtful relationships."]
          [:p "I held onto my desire to produce the encouragement cards while at the same time pursuing my dream to reach out to hurting people through counseling, writing, and speaking. Following my dreams has taken me on a challenging, disruptive, and life-giving journey, which included moving to Seattle, Washington in 2002 to earn my Master of Arts in Counseling and Certification in Domestic Violence Advocacy under the direction of Dr. Dan Allender at Mars Hill Graduate School (now named The Seattle School of Theology and Psychology)."]
          [:p "My journey continues to unfold in ways that reveal God's faithfulness to guide and provide. Although I had a private practice, Hearts Unfolding Counseling, in Washington, in 2006 I moved back to Wisconsin so I could be near my children and grandchildren. For 8 1/2 years I worked full-time at ASTOP Sexual Abuse Center in Fond du Lac, counseling victims of sexual abuse and leading many groups for these courageous survivors. At the same time, I continued my private counseling practice at an office in Oshkosh. Beginning in 2015, I am now exclusively seeing clients at my private practice in Oshkosh."]

Dan Allender draws us into deeper curiosity about this impact when he states that we are \"profoundly shaped by the events of our lives and our responses to those events. Our stories impact us either unconsciously or consciously. It's up to us to decide whether we'll be passive recipients or active agents in the shaping of our lives.\""]
          [:p "Our goal in the group is to connect in healing ways with ourselves and each other as we reflect on the suffering and disappointments we've experienced. Courageously and honestly telling our stories will help meet our need to be known and heard. It also will lead to richer relationships as we become free from the shame and fear that have silenced us in the past. This redemptive journey will ultimately lead to greater joy as God uses our past to open our future."]])

One of my sons died, so I am intimately acquainted with the grieving process. Because I had spent so many years hiding my pain, denying problems, and pretending I was fine, when my life fell apart, no one believed me when I revealed the truth about the verbal and emotional abuse in my marriage - we had looked so good on the outside. Much rejection from my church and family followed the disclosure of abuse and alcoholism, so I understand the dynamics in a family and a culture that prefers to deny truth and believe the lies of abusers."]
          [:p "I continue to be in the ongoing process of being transformed by the renewal of my mind (Romans 12:2), so I know how difficult the journey is to change the patterns of thinking and relating that developed in response to childhood trauma, fears, and perceptions. Even more difficult was seeing how I had hurt my children by my old patterns of avoidance, denial of feelings, needing to be right, and people-pleasing. Sorrow over the past feels like walking through the valley of the shadow of death, but it leads to life and freedom."]
          [:p "I began college when my youngest child began kindergarten, so I know what it is like for a single mom to pursue an education in hopes of following her dreams. When my youngest graduated from high school, I sold my home in Wisconsin and moved to Washington, where I knew no one, to attend Mars Hill Graduate School. I believed that this school would move me along in my journey to become the person I needed to be in order to more effectively meet the needs of others who are hurting."]

I knew I had more work to do on changing me. Indeed, I had more fears to face, more old patterns to change, and more wounds to grieve before I was ready to begin my counseling practice.
