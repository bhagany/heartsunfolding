          [:p "It was in 1984, after overwhelming difficulties, that life-giving Bible verses led me on a healing journey that continues to this day. Despite many painful situations, I still believed that God worked all things together for good for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose."]
          [:p "I wondered if somehow God was answering a prayer I had prayed when I was eighteen, “Lord, some day I want to speak, not from my head, but passionately from my heart, about an issue close to Your heart.” But, what was He calling me to do?"]
          [:p "I thought about my love of hearts, writing, and Psalm 119:130, “The unfolding of Your Words gives light.” Hoping to be inspired, I cut and folded heart shapes. A tri-fold heart-shape emerged, giving birth to Hearts Unfolding Cards."]
          [:p "I was excited, knowing I had found a way to share the Bible verses that had assured me of God’s presence in my suffering. I envisioned artwork that illustrated growth and transformation, because I was so grateful for the emotional and spiritual growth that followed my brokenness."]
          [:p "While I worked on the cards, I also pursued my dreams to reach out to hurting people through counseling, writing, and speaking. Following my dreams has taken me on a challenging and life-giving journey. After I earned my master’s degree in counseling at age 60, I had to come up with a name for my private practice. The only name that seemed right was Hearts Unfolding Counseling. I continue to see clients at my private practice in Oshkosh."]
